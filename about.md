Sometimes we're just goofing around.  Other times we're building something that we need for our own professional lives.  Most of the time, we're just trying to help people.  We hope you enjoy our work.

## Join our community

We use GitHub to collaborate on our projects.  All open-source contributors are welcome to join our community.  Those who are dedicated to our mission may also be invited to join our organization and help lead projects.
